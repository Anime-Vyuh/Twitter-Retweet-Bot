Have you ever wanted to make a [Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/AnimeVyuh) but don't know how to start or create it. Then you have just landed on the best place. I shall break through the complete process of how even a non-programmer can make a Twitter Retweet bot on his own. Trust me it is damn easy. So let's get started.

Let us first talk about the prerequisites required for both programmers and non-programmers. For non-programmers, you did know how to copy and paste and install the software. You first need to download [Python](https://animevyuh.org/learn-python/) and PIP in your local system and should have at least one text editor. For programmers, you need to know Python programming. You can brush up on your Python Programming skills with [Anime Vyuh Python Tutorials](https://animevyuh.org/category/python-tutorials/).
